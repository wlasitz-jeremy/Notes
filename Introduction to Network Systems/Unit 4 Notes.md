The Media Access Control sub-layer deals with the protocols that specify the methods and functions used to convert data to bits, place it on the media, and reverse that process at the destination. 

Leased Line WAN links:
A leased line is a dedicated connection between a piece of equipment at the customer location to a piece of equipment at the lprovider location. Leased lines aare expensive because the media is not shared with other customers and are alwyas avaliable as they proovide reliability. They focus on delivering bits between sites rather than frames. 

High level data link control:

The most common encapsulation protocol at layer 2 for WAN links using leased lines. A bit oriented protocol uses 8-bit flags to indicate the beginning and the end of each frame. Many WAN links are asynchronus. The beginning and ending flags allow the devices to recognize the individual frames. They also can be used for point to point or multi point connections. 

Point to point is an encapsulation which provides direct connection between 2 devices(routers) without any other hosts involved. They can be used over many types of physical networks, including serial cable, telephone lines.They provide a mechanism to distinguish individual frames from each other. Frame relay is a non-broadcast multi-access WAN technology. Customers use special equipment(Data Communication Equipment Data Terminal Equipment) to convert to the probiders network. Devices are configured with virtual circuts which provide source and destination information (Data link identifier) but they allow the shared networkto move the frames as necessary. It delivers frames bwtween sites. Frame Relay is being phased out in favor of ethernet WANs.
