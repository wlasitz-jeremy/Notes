The physical layer has an industry standardization which uses a shared set of standards allowing manufactures to build devices and transmission media that connects to media and devices from any other manufacturer on any network.

The physical layer is the transmission and reception of bits.

Data connection types:

- A simplex is a data connection that only works in one direction 
- A half duplex  is a data connection that will work in 2 different directions, but only in a single direction at a time
-A full duplex is a data connection that will work in 2 different directions, both working simultaneously



Bit Encoding:
Bits must first be converted to physical signals for transmission across media. Bits can be encoded to voltage levels for transmission over copper cables. Binary zero is equal to 0volts wheras Binary one is equal to +5 volts. Bits can be encoded to optical light levels  for transmission over fiber optic cables. Binary 0is equal to a dim light whereas Binary one is equal to a bright light. 

Units of measurement:

Bandwidth is described as the difference between the maximum and minimum frequencies in a wave form. Typically measured in Hertz (cycles per second). In networking bandwidth is understood to be the maximum rate at which bits can be moved. Throughput is the measure of actual movement of bits through media. Equipment and media will commonly be marked with a measurement of bandwidth with certian units: BPS, KBPS, MBPS, GBPS. 

Communication Media Types:
- Copper wire
    - Twisted pair
        - Unshielded twisted pair
        - Shielded twisted pair
    - Coaxial (Legacy)        
- Optical fiber
    - Single mode (SM)
    - Multi Mode (MM)
- Radio Frequency
    - WIFI 802.11
    - Bluetooth 802.15

Twisted pair cables have multiple pairs of wires and each pair is twisted separatly. Networking cables almost alwyas have 4 pairs. Signals are transmitted or recieved on a single wire. The twisting reduces both the emmisions of noise from the pair and the reception of noise from the pair. This is created by induction on the wire. Each pair in the cable has a different rate of twists per foot so signals emitted by one pair will not be recieved by another. This is called CROSSTALK. The unshielded twisted pair is the most common cab;e in the network and inexpensive compared to the shielded pair, coaxial, or optical. The shielded pair has a foil shield surrounding each pair of wires. This foil reduces the EMI/RFI noise interference. This cable is much more expensive so generally only used in excessivly noisey environments.
