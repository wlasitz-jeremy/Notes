Module 1

Computer Software 

-A Program is a set of code that has instructions which tells a computer how to perform
-Programming is the process of writing the programs
-Programming languages are used to implement programs
-Syntax is how you write a certain programming language

Programming Languages 

-Examples: Python,Java,Javascript, C#, C++, React
-Each Programming language has 
	-Constructs: Numbers or Strings
	-Syntax: Describes which strings of characters and symbols are constructed properly
	-Static Semantics: Defines which sentence has meaning 
	-Semantics: Defines the meaning of the sentences
-Low level languages vs high level languages
-General vs targeted
-Interperted vs compiled
-Low level are machine friendly, faster, and memory efficient 
-Programers understand high level languages becuase they use words

Low Level Languages 
-Binary and Assembly Languages and they are quite similar

High Level Languages 
-Interperted and Compiled 
-Interperted translates line by line every time wheras compiled does it all together only when you compile it 

Computer Programming Errors
-Syntax and Logical Errors
	-Syntax errors are mistakes in the code such as spelling or labels and symbols
	-Logical errors are mistakes in the code and result with incorrect or unexpected behaviour which can be difficult to find and fix

Python
-Simple to use
-Splits programs into modules
-High level language
-Offers error checking
-Saves time when building programming
