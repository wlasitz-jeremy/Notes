-A program is a set of statements for a computer to perform a task

-A statement is a command or instruction with a task

-A variable contains a named memory location. It is a container for storing data value. 

Enclose a variable in sinle quotations to assign it to the variable, and in double quotations for a string variable.

Variables must meet the following rules:
- Contains letters or numeric digits, dashes and underscores 
- Must begin with a letter or underscore
- Cannot have special characters
- Case sensitive (N and n are different)
- Starts with lowercase letters
- Cannot have space, use underscore instead

Naming Conventions for variables: 
-Camel case: Starts with small letter then capitalize the first letter of every following word = firstName
-Snake case: put underscore between words = first_name
-Pascal case: Capitalize first latter in each word = FirstName 

Literal values have data types
-Numeric is an integer
-String encloses a sequence of variables in single or double quotations
-Boolean data types are either true or false

Staticlly typed languages are C, Java, Java Script, C-sharp, HTML wheras python is a dynamically typed language. Static languages you must determine the data of the variable at compile time whereas python there is no decleration. 

A constant is a value that cannot be changed. Use uppercase letters with underscores to separating words. They are usually created in a module. 

Type conversion is the process of converting the value of one data type to any other data type. 

Implicit casting - Python interpreter automatically converts one datatype to another 

Explicit casting - Changes a datatype manually or force it to be changed. Put the datatype you want before said variable.

Print is a built in fuction which displays a specific message to the screen.
